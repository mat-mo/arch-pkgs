Bug fixes:
 * fixed "Interfaces added with singleton_class.instance_eval aren't
   exported" (Issue#22, by miaoufkirsh)

 * Ruby strings can be passed where byte arrays ("ay") are expected 
   (Issue#40, by Jesper B. Rosenkilde)

Bug fixes:

   by Ernest Bursa). MM introspection produces two elements
   for a single interface; merge them.

  (Damiano Stoffie)

   as allowed by the specification (Noah Meyerhans).

   (Issue#31, by Damiano Stoffie)

== Ruby D-Bus 0.8.0 - 2012-09-20

Features:
 * Add Anonymous authentication (Issue#27, by Walter Brebels).
 * Use Nokogiri for XML parsing when available (Issue#24, by Geoff Youngs).

Bug fixes:
 * Use SCM_CREDS authentication only on FreeBSD, not on OpenBSD (Issue#21,
   reported by Adde Nilsson).
 * Recognize signature "h" (UNIX_FD) used eg. by Upstart (Issue#23,
   by Bernd Ahlers).
 * Find the session bus also via launchd, on OS X (Issue#20, reported
   by Paul Sturgess).

   DBus::Main#run when a service becomes idle (by Ravil Bayramgalin)

   and threads.

 * Fixed ruby-1.9.2 compatibility again (Issue#12).
 * Fixed authentication on BSD (Issue#11, by Jonathan Walker)
 * Fixed exiting a nested event loop for synchronous calls
   (reported by Timo Warns).
 * Fixed introspection calls leaking reply handlers.
 * "rake test" now works, doing what was called "rake env:test"

== Ruby D-Bus 0.6.0 - 2010-12-11

Features:
 * Clients can access properties conveniently (Ticket#28).

Bug fixes:
 * Service won't crash whan handling an unknown method or interface (Ticket#31).
 * Don't send an invalid error name when it originates from a NameError.

== Ruby D-Bus 0.5.0 - 2010-11-07

Features:
 * Better binding of Ruby Exceptions to D-Bus Errors.
 * Converted the package to a Gem (Issue#6).
 * Converted the tutorial from Webgen to Markdown.

Bug fixes:
 * Don't pass file descriptors to subprocesses.
 * Fixed InterfaceElement::validate_name (Ticket#38, by Herwin Weststrate).

 * Classes should not share all interfaces (Ticket#36/Issue#5)

== Ruby D-Bus 0.3.1 - 2010-07-22

Bug fixes:
 * Many on_signal could cause DBus.Error.LimitsExceeded bnc#617350).
   Don't add a match rule that already exists, enable removing match
   rules. Now only one handler for a rule is called (but it is possible
   for one signal to match more rules). This reverts the half-fix done
   to fix Issue#3
 * Re-added InterfaceElement#add_param for compatibility.
 * Handle more ways which tell us that a bus connection has died.

== Ruby D-Bus 0.3.0 - 2010-03-28

   on Ubuntu Karmic (Ticket#34).
 * Get the session bus address even if unset in ENV (Issue#4).
 * Improved exceptions a bit:
   UndefinedInterface, InvalidMethodName, NoMethodError, no RuntimeException

 These are by Klaus Kaempf:
 * Make the signal dispatcher call all handlers (Issue#3).
 * Run on Ruby < 1.8.7 (Issue#2).
 * Avoid needless DBus::IncompleteBufferException (Ticket#33).
 * Don't ignore DBus Errors in request_service, raise them (Ticket#32).

Features:

 * Automatic signature inference for variants.
 * Introduced FormalParameter where a plain pair had been used.

== Ruby D-Bus 0.2.12 - 2010-01-24

   would fail with "undefined method `get_node' for nil:NilClass"
   (Tickets#25 and #29).

   (Ticket#31).
 * Rescue exceptions in dbus_methods and reply with DBus errors instead of
   crashing (da1l6).
 * Better exception messages when sending nil, or mismatched structs.
